The cows are taking a multiple choice test. But instead of a standard
test where your selected choices are scored for each question
individually and then summed, in this test your selected choices are
summed before being scored.

Specifically, you are given $N$ ($2\le N\le 10^5$) groups of integer
vectors on the 2D plane, where each vector is denoted by an ordered pair
$(x,y)$. Choose one vector from each group such that the sum of the
vectors is as far away from the origin as possible.

It is guaranteed that the total number of vectors is at most $2\cdot
10^5$. Each group has size at least $2$, and within a group, all vectors
are distinct. It is also guaranteed that every $x$ and $y$ coordinate
has absolute value at most $\frac{10^9}{N}$.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):

The first line contains $N$, the number of groups.

Each group starts with $G$, the number of vectors in the group, followed
by $G$ lines containing the vectors in that group. Consecutive groups
are separated by newlines.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):

The maximum possible squared Euclidean distance.

SAMPLE INPUT:

    3

    2
    -2 0
    1 0

    2
    0 -2
    0 1

    3
    -5 -5
    5 1
    10 10

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

    242

It is optimal to select $(1,0)$ from the first group, $(0,1)$ from the
second group, and $(10,10)$ from the third group. The sum of these
vectors is $(11,11)$, which is squared distance $11^2+11^2=242$ from the
origin.

SCORING:

-   In test cases 1-5, the total number of vectors is at most $10^3$.
-   In test cases 6-9, every group has size exactly two.
-   Test cases 10-17 satisfy no additional constraints.

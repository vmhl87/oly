The cows have formed a dance team, and Farmer John is their
choreographer! The team's latest and greatest dance involves $N$ cows
($2 \le N \le 10^6$) standing in a line. Each move in the dance involves
two cows, up to $K$ positions apart ($1 \le K < N$), gracefully jumping
and landing in each other's position.

There are two types of cows in the line â€“ Guernseys and Holsteins. As
such, Farmer John has documented the dance as a sequence of length-$N$
binary strings, where a $0$ represents a Guernsey, a $1$ represents a
Holstein, and the overall string represents how the cows are arranged in
the line.

Unfortunately, Farmer Nhoj (who choreographs for a rival team) has
sabotaged the dance and erased all but the first and last binary
strings! With a big competition quickly approaching, Farmer John must
waste no time in reconstructing the dance.

Given these two binary strings, help Farmer John find the minimum number
of moves in the dance!

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):

The first line contains $N$ and $K$.

The second line contains the first binary string.

The third line contains the last binary string.

It is guaranteed that both binary strings contain the same number of
ones.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):

The minimum number of moves in the dance.

SAMPLE INPUT:

    4 1
    0111
    1110

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

    3

One possible dance:

    0111 -> 1011 -> 1101 -> 1110

SAMPLE INPUT:

    5 2
    11000
    00011

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

    3

One possible dance:

    11000 -> 01100 -> 00110 -> 00011

SAMPLE INPUT:

    5 4
    11000
    00011

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

    2

One possible dance:

    11000 -> 10010 -> 00011

SCORING:

-   Inputs 4-5: $K=1$
-   Inputs 6-7: Both strings have at most $8$ ones.
-   Inputs 8-15: $N\le 5000$
-   Inputs 16-23: No additional constraints.

Bessie has recently gotten into chemistry. At the moment, she has two
different colors $1$ and $2$ of various liquids that don't mix well with
one another. She has two test tubes of infinite capacity filled with $N$
$(1 \leq N \leq 10^5)$ units each of some mixture of liquids of these
two colors. Because the liquids donâ€™t mix, once they settled, they
divided into layers of separate colors. Because of this, the two tubes
can be viewed as strings $f_1f_2\ldots f_N$ and $s_1s_2\ldots s_N$ where
$f_i$ represents the color of the liquid that is $i$ units from the
bottom of the first tube, and $s_i$ represents the color of the liquid
that is $i$ units from the bottom of the second tube. It is guaranteed
that there is at least one unit of each color of liquid.

Bessie wants to separate these liquids so that each test tube contains
all units of one color of liquid. She has a third empty beaker of
infinite capacity to help her in this task. When Bessie makes a "pour",
she moves all liquid of color $i$ at the top of one test tube or beaker
into another.

Determine the minimum number of pours to separate all the liquid into
the two test tubes, and the series of moves needed to do so. It does not
matter which test tube ends up with which color, but the beaker must be
empty..

There will be $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 10$) test cases, with a parameter $P$
for each test case.

Suppose the minimum number of pours to separate the liquids into the
original tubes is $M$.

-   If $P=1$, you will receive credit if you print only $M$.
-   If $P=2$, you will receive credit if you print an integer $A$ such
    that $M \leq A \leq M+5$, followed by $A$ lines that construct a
    solution with that number of moves. Each line should contain the
    source and the destination tube ($1$, $2$, or $3$ for the beaker).
    The source tube must be nonempty before the move and a tube may not
    be poured into itself.
-   If $P=3$, you will receive credit if you print $M$, followed by a
    valid construction using that number of moves.

INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):

The first line contains $T$, the. number of test cases. For each test
case, the next line contains $N$ and $P$ representing the amount each
test tube is initially filled to, and the query type. The following line
contains $f_1f_2f_3\ldots f_N$ representing the first test tube. $f_i
\in \{ 1,2 \}$ and $f_1$ represents the bottom of the test tube. The
subsequent line contains $s_1s_2s_3\ldots s_N$ representing the second
test tube. $s_i \in \{ 1,2 \}$ and $s_1$ represents the bottom of the
test tube.

It is guaranteed that there will be at least one $1$ and one $2$ across
both input strings.

OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):

For each test case, you will print a single number representing the
minimum pours to separate the liquid in the test tubes. Depending on the
query type, you may also need to provide a valid construction.

In the first three test cases, the minimum number of pours to separate
the tubes is $4$. We can see how the following moves separate the test
tubes:

Initial state:

    1: 1221
    2: 2211
    3: 

After the move "1 2":

    1: 122
    2: 22111
    3: 

After the move "1 3":

    1: 1
    2: 22111
    3: 22

After the move "2 1":

    1: 1111
    2: 22
    3: 22

After the move "3 2":

    1: 1111
    2: 2222
    3:

In the last test case, the minimum amount of pours is $5$. However,
since $P=2$, the given construction with $6$ moves is valid since it is
within $5$ pours from the optimal answer.

SCORING:

-   Inputs 2-6: $P = 1$
-   Inputs 7-11: $P=2$
-   Inputs 12-21: No additional constraints.

Additionally, it is guaranteed that $T=10$ for all inputs besides the
sample.

make many triangles (atcoder)
	debug this sometime

milk sum (USACO)
	figure out why bs and psum isn't working
	correctly when they theoretically should

lazy segment tree
	fix propagation so that it
	goes back up as well as down

fenwick tree
	add update method

line segment intersection (CSES)
	find edge case and fix it

exponentiation II (CSES)
	figure out how to properly binary
	exponentiate with two levels of exponents

reading books (CSES)
	need to find a way to compute the closest
	sum of books that is at least half the
	total amount of time necessary - dp is
	likely not an option

distinct value queries (CSES)
	find alternate way to represent data or
	make segtree faster

forest queries (CSES)
	fix 2d range summable segtree

grid paths (CSES, hard one)
	rewrite recursive section so it only iterates
	over the array once; should be fast

book shop (CSES)
	debug knapsack dp

towers (CSES)

grid paths (CSES, hard one)
	rewrite recursive section so it only iterates
	over the array once; should be fast

sum of 4 values (CSES)
	think of a new algorithm that does not take
	up prohibitively high amounts of memory

book shop (CSES)
	debug knapsack dp

towers (CSES)
	figure out how to sort and organize better

grid paths (CSES, weird one)
	figure out why it's failing on case 3, also why
	it doesn't offer speed improvements

	partially done; right idea but imp fail

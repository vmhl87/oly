exponentiation II (CSES)
	figure out how to properly binary
	exponentiate with two levels of exponents

reading books (CSES)
	need to find a way to compute the closest
	sum of books that is at least half the
	total amount of time necessary - dp is
	likely not an option

distinct value queries (CSES)
	find alternate way to represent data or
	make segtree faster

forest queries (CSES)
	fix 2d range summable segtree

grid paths (CSES, hard one)
	rewrite recursive section so it only iterates
	over the array once; should be fast

book shop (CSES)
	debug knapsack dp

towers (CSES)
	figure out how to sort and organize better

grid paths (CSES, weird one)
	figure out why it's failing on case 3, also why
	it doesn't offer speed improvements

cowlibi (2023 february silver 1)
	partially done; right idea but imp fail

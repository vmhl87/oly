-- START @ 15:00 --

3:09  work out small cases on A

3:13  start writing tree case on A

3:15  maybe graph case works when decomp to MST

3:16  wait maybe not

3:17  oh maybe it is some sort of multisource almost-bfs

3:25  submit small case A (subtask 1 AC)

3:26  start working on degree-thing for A

3:31  no this doesnt work

3:32  uh no wait it might

3:33  hmmm

3:54  submit spfa-like solution for A (subtask 2 AC)

3:55  resub with subtask 3 bounds (AC)

4:09  might as well bruteforce B

4:19  submit bruteforce B (AC subt 1,2 TLE subt 3)

4:28  better const fact

4:41  hopefully better const (50 pts AC subt 1,2,3)

5:25  3 subtask for C (51 pts subt 1,2,3)

6:30  hopefully 4 subt C (81 pts subt 1,2,3,4)

6:39  theoretically ratio 15 C (82 pts subt 1,2,3,4 partial 5)

6:50  surely B is doable

7:21  so cooked

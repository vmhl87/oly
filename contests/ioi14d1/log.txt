-- START @ 6:30 --

6:48 p2 looks doable with some segtrees

7:07 got the range combiner I think

7:46 first submission to p2 (WA)

7:48 resub with bounds fixed (WA)

7:58 resub with fix for range combination (61 pts, RTE big case)

8:00 resub with bounds (AC)

9:26 finish n^2 for p1 (8, oversight in search)

9:42 fixup ordering, submit (30, RTE from bounds)

9:56 fix another ordering (30 again)

10:00 yet another ordering (30 AGAIN)

10:14 attempt (no difference)

10:20 try for partials on C - some component merge stuff

10:42 submit for C (WA)

11:03 revise approach (42 pts, RTE big case)

11:05 see if passes w/ bounds increase (42 pts, TLE big case)

11:15 give up and try to fight with p1 for some more

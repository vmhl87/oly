-- START @ 15:00 --

3:01  bruh i have seen A before

3:02  B looks interesting

3:10  I might as well writeup a small case for B

3:21  submit small sol for B (2 subtasks, 21 pts)

3:22  surely discord is a distraction and I should close

3:26  oh I can pretty easily get subt 3

3:33  submit subt 3 attempt (hybrid) (wrong answer on all somehow?)

3:37  resubmit (< vs <=) (still 0 pts)

4:18  dude idk im moving on

4:41  start working on C i guess

4:49  submit small case for C (3 subtasks, 68 pts)

4:50  maybe ternary search or something works

4:53  wait ill try to prove non convex

4:56  by gen testcase spam i conclude that convexity does not hold

5:09  maybe i can bruteforce A subtask 1

5:24  submit small case A (49 pts)

5:40  back to debugging B it is

6:50  its actually so over wth

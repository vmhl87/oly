--- START @ 6:45 ---

6:47 read thru p1 and seems doable

6:54 start p1

7:03 writeup trivial case for p1 (forgot edge case)

7:05 submit (still WA sub 3)

7:08 submit with edge case fixed (no)

7:09 fixed now? (still no)

7:13 hopefully this works (20 pts, subt 1-3)

7:21 wrote up next set of tc (get subt 4, sketchy logic so yeah)

7:23 fixed maybe (55 pts, subt 1-6)

7:34 finished full sol? (subt 7, none others)

7:35 corrected wrong mod (subt 1-9, TLE last)

7:39 binary exp (AC)

7:42 uhh what i do now :notlikeduck:

7:59 start working on p2

8:24 p2 subt 234 sol (35 pts, subt 234)

8:40 submit w/ small case solver (subt 1-4 ac)

9:00 ykw ill just bruteforce p3 small case because what else

9:18 submit p3 subt 1 (7 pts ac)

9:52 after thinking about p2 for a while, maybe do some ordering approach?

9:59 i claim that i am screwed on p3

10:09 i tentatively claim that i am also screwed on p2

10:32 yeah im screwed on p2 lmao
